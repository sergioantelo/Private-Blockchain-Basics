You only need actually the run_app.py, node_server.py and the templates folder.

Starting blockchain nodes:
- python node_server.py <port> (the <> does not have to be written)

Starting website:
- python run_app.py <port_of_blockchain_node_for_SYNC> <port_where_to_host_website>

Registering a node with another node:
- curl -X POST -d "{\"node_address\":\"http://127.0.0.1:8000\"}" -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8001/register_with
  after this 8001 appears in the peers list of 8000 and 8000 in the peers list of 8001
  8001 will copy the chain of 8000

How to build the network?
How to propagate transactions/mined blocks?
Which nodes receive a mining request?
