You only need actually the run_app.py, node_server.py and the templates folder.

Starting blockchain nodes:
- python node_server.py <port> (the <> does not have to be written)

Starting website:
- python run_app.py <port_where_to_host_website> <port_of_blockchain_node_for_SYNC> <port_of_further_node> ...
  after specifying the port where to host, you specify the ports of the nodes in the blockchain network
  the first node address will be used to fetch the blockchain for visualizing

Registering a node with another node:
- curl -X POST -d "{\"peers_list\":[\"http://127.0.0.1:8000\"]}" -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8001/register_with
  after this 8001 appears in the peers list of 8000 and 8000 in the peers list of 8001
  8001 will copy the chain of 8000
  peers_list can indeed be a list, then the new node will register to all of the specified node addresses

How to build the network?
How to propagate transactions/mined blocks?
Which nodes receive a mining request?

If one wants to change the attributes of a block one has to be adapt then the functions
verify_and_add_block and create_chain_from_dump everywhere where we receive a json object from a getchain request
and we want to change this into a python blockchain/block object.
